Although the petroleum sector is important, as Nigeria's government revenues still heavily rely on this sector, it remains a small part of the country's overall economy. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up with the country's rapid population growth. Nigeria was once a large net exporter of food, but currently imports some of its food products. Mechanization has led to a resurgence in the manufacturing and exporting of food products, and there was consequently a move towards food sufficiency.[33]In 2006, Nigeria came to an agreement with theParis Clubto buy back the bulk of its owed debts from them, in exchange for a cash payment of roughly US$12 billion.[34]\",\n",
